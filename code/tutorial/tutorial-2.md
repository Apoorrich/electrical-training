# Firmware Training Session 2
In this session, we'll learn how I2C protocol functions, develop a library for the Haptic Driver on the training board, and use it to interface with the Piezo buzzer onboard.

## Piezo Buzzer
Piezo Buzzer are used for making beeps, tones and alerts, they look like this on your board.

Piezo Buzzer utlises the effect called "Piezoelectric effect". In casual words it means: if you squeeze them, you can make electricity flow through them. The reverse also applies: if electricity flows through, they will squeeze themselves.
Which means, if you apply voltage and then let go of the voltage, it will essentially vibrates and create sound. 
We will use this property to make it generate sound.


## Haptic Driver
Haptic driver provides the necessary signal to make a piezo buzzer "buzz". They're the IC right next to the piezo buzzer. 
We will need to talk to the haptic driver via I2C protocol. 

## I2C
A standard I2C is composed of 4 parts: **Start Condition, address frame, data fram and Stop Condition**

The following is a standard I2C communication. You can understand this after reading the following 4 paragraphs.
![Sample I2C](images/i2c.png)

### Start Condition
To initiate a communication, the master device will leave SCL high (since SCL is constantly pulled high) and pull SDA low. This will notify all slave devices that a communication is going to happen. 
Just for fun fact if more than one master wish to transmit, whichever pulls SDA low first gains the control.

### Address Frame
After start condition is always the address frame. Usually address frame will have a 7-bit address (note that address is different from address frame), which points to what device and at what register (we'll talk about this later) we want to read/write to. Then it's followed by a R/W bit indicating this is either a read(1) or write(0) action. 
The 9th bit is the NACK/ACK bit. Once the first 8 bits were sent, slave device gain control over SDA line. If slave device did not pull this line low, it means that it either did not get the message or did not know how to interpret it. It is up to the master device to determine what happens next. This applies to both address frame and data frame. 

### Data Frame
Data will be transmitted after the address frame has completed transmission. Either slave/master will drive the SDA line depending on the R/W bit specified earlier in the address frame. There will also be a NACK/ACK bit appended to the end of transmitted data.

### Stop condition
The master will send a stop condition when data tranmission are complete. Stop condition is defined as a 0 to 1 change in SCL followed by 0 to 1 change in SDA. Be aware that this stop condition might be accidentally triggerred during data transmission so don't change SDA when SCL is pulled high.

### Test your learning!
Now get back to the I2C comm image and see if you understand what it means.

## Back to Haptic driver
To control the haptic driver, we need to know where in the haptic driver , and what exactly we need to write into those locations. To figure out all of that, we need the datasheet and Setup Guide
[DRV2605 Setup Guide](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa189/sloa189.pdf)
[DRV2605 Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf)
I know it seems intimidating, but we'll tackle it.

### Device Address and Register Map
First we need to figure out what is the address to the haptic driver. We can find this either in the 2nd page of Setup Guide or 23rd page of datasheet. 

However it turns out that haptic driver is controlled by the many registers(memory storage unit) inside of it. To control the haptic drive we need to write to them. A collection of registers can be found in the **Register Map** section in the datasheet. 

We will cover the function of each register later. As of now, understand that your message need to be **Device address** + **Register Address** + **Data**. As the I2C message will first identify the slave, which is the haptic driver in this case, and then the register, and finally will transmit the data.

### How to write a simple I2C message to the Haptic Driver
I don't want to reinvent wheels therefore we will use a library called Wire.h that helps send I2C message. 

Now open up a new arduino sketch and add the following at the top
```
#include <Wire.h>
```

We only concern 4 of the functions in this library for now. `Wire.begin()`, which tells that the 2 data pins are now dedicated for I2C communication, `Wire.beginTransmission(Device Address)`, prepare a series of device address and wait to be sent out, `Wire.write(address/data)`, prepare more bits and append them to the previous data,  `Wire.endTransmision()`, send all bits to the slave device.

Therefore if we want to write a 0xFF value to the register at address 0x16 in Haptic driver, this is what we need to do. 

```
Wire.begin();                 // Be aware that this only need to happen once while all of the following commands must be used
// everytime you try to send an I2C message
Wire.beginTransmission(0x5A); // 0x5A is the device address of the haptic driver, specified in the datasheet
Wire.write(0x16);             // 0x16 is the address of the register we want to write to
Wire.write(0xA5);             // 0xFF is the value we decided to write
Wire.endTransmision();        // None of the previous codes actually sends anything. This is the only line of code
// that sends out the bits
```

If this gets correctly sent out, register at 0x16 in haptic driver now has the value of 0xA5.

**Take additional attention to see how each of the bits in 0xA5 maps to individual bits in the register at 0x16.**

### Set up the Haptic Driver and Understand how we can interface with it
However the Haptic driver is not ready to work all the time, everytime we re-power it on, it enters a STANDBY mode that will not do anything. To play with the haptic driver, we need to send an I2C message to get out of STANDBY mode.

Now clear your `void setup()` and `void loop()`, Read the 2nd page of Setup Guide, refer to the register map in datasheet and **write a single I2C message that will set the haptic driver out of STANDBY Mode**. Remember this only need to be executed once so it should go in `void setup()`

### Expand Your Code to a Function
Now based off what you have just written, **write a function that takes in a register address and a data, and transmit that to the *haptic driver***.

### Mode Selection
In page 20 of the DRV2605 datasheet, it shows that DRV2605 has different modes of operation. Because we have IN/TRIG pin short to ground, both External Trigger modes, Analog Input and PWM mode have become unavailable to us. RTP, Diagnostics and Calibration modes are something we don't want to touch for now. 

![Mode Selection Table](images/Mode_Selection_Table.png)

Between Internal trigger mode and Audio-to-vibe mode, we will choose Internal trigger mode for the ease of operation.

Internal trigger mode uses the GO bit to fire the playback of the waveform in the waveform sequencer. We will cover waveform library and waveform sequencer momentarily. Right now, refer to the table on P20 of datasheet and Register map to **write code that sets the DRV2605 to internal trigger mode.** This also only need to happen **once**.

### Waveform Library
DRV2605 comes with built library of waveforms. Since we cannot use PWM/Analog input, we will instead just use built in libraries. 

On Page 14, the datasheet introduced the libraries and how to select a certain library. **Write code to select one of the appropriate libraries** More information about each library can be found in this table (P21) 

![ERM Library Table](images/ERM_LIBRARY_TABLE.png)

The list of waveforms in the libraries is in page 57 of the DRV2605 datasheet.

### Waveform Sequencer
Now we're on the verge of letting the buzzer make some noise. All we need to do is to put the waveform into the sequencer and hit the Go button.

We find the type of waveform we'd like to play from p57 and write their *EFFECT ID NO.* to the sequencer. For now, use *Transition Ramp Up Medium Smooth 1 â€“ 0 to 100%* followed by a *Strong Click - 100%*. You end the sequencer by writing 0 to the sequencer register after the last waveform. Find the address of the Waveform sequencer in the register map. **Write a function that puts two arbitrary waveforms into the sequencer** and **a function that set all of the waveform sequencer to 0**, then queue the 2 designated waveform into waveform sequencer using the function you wrote. 

### Hit the GO Button
As of now, your code should look something like this
```
#include <Wire.h>

void setup(){
    // Some code that initialize DRV2605
    // Code that change DRV2605 to internal trigger mode
    // Code that select an appropriate library
    // Code that queue up 2 designated waveform into the sequencer
}

void loop(){
}

void writeRegister(argument_1, argument_2, ...){
    // Writes data into a register in DRV2605
}


void queueWaveform(argument_1, argument_2){
    // Queues waveform into waveform sequencer
}

void clearWaveformSequencer(){
    // Set all waveform sequencer to 0
}
```

in `void loop()`, add a function that set the GO bit so that the waveform may be played as well as a `delay(1000)` so as not to jam up the haptic driver.

### Final Setup
There are some other registers you want to set before setting the DRV2605 to internal trigger mode. These registers control features that are generally irrelevant to buzzer and they better stayed turned off:

|Register Name|Address|Value|
|---|---|---|
|RTP_INPUT|0x02|0x00|
|ODT|0x0D|0x00|
|SPT|0x0E|0x00|
|SNT|0x0F|0x00|
|BRT|0x10|0x00|
|ATH_MAX_INPUT|0x13|0xFF|
|N_ERM_LRA|0x1A|0x36|
|ERM_OPEN_LOOP|0x1D|0xA0|
